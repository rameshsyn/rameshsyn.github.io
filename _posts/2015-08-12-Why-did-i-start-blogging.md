  During my school time, I wasn't good at essay, letter, paragraph and story writing. 
Even though teacher taught me a way of writing an essay (Introduction, Body , Conclusion),
i used to get lost on the way writing. Simply, i wasn't fluent on writing. 

  I was an introvert guy, later on i discovered this was a problem, i never been fluent on writing.
Still, i get lost when i am writing. So, to overcome this problem i started blogging. Along with this main 
problem following are the reasons why i started blogging. 

### 1. Sharing is learning 
  > "The best part of learning is sharing what you know" - Vaughn K. Lauer.
  
  Sharing is also helping and caring.
### 2. Express myself
  one of the main problem in my life till now is , i never succeeded to answer question "who you are ?" and 
  I have left blank in about section  in my online accounts (LOL). As to indentify myself (who am i) , i have
  to express myself. Blog is where i can express myself.
### 3. Develop writing skill
Blogging is writing  


I am planning write a blog about coding, mylife, new places and many more .
